## How to run this skill

Start immediately. Your first reply is (1) the banner, then (2) the
precondition check, then (3) the first `AskUserQuestion` in Step 1.

Do not explore the repo. Do not summarise the skill back. Do not run
`Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash ls`, or `Task` agents. Everything you need is
in this file.

## Banner

Print verbatim:

```
teamfuse · add channel
───────────────────────
```

## Preconditions

1. `admin_create_channel` is callable.
2. `agents.config.json` exists so the skill can offer known aliases as
   pickable members.

## Flow

### Step 1: gather inputs

* **Channel name.** 3 to 32 chars, lowercase alphanumeric + hyphen.
  No leading `#`. Reject names that already appear via
  `list_channels`.
* **Description.** Optional. Up to 200 chars.
* **Members.** Multi-select from the aliases in `agents.config.json`
  plus the operator alias. Default: none.

### Step 2: create the channel

```
admin_create_channel({
  name: "<name>",
  description: "<description>",
  members: [<alias>, ...]
})
```

On `channel_taken`: tell the operator the channel already exists. Ask
whether to seed members into it anyway (calls
`admin_set_channel_members`) or abort.

### Step 3: print the summary

```
Channel #<name> created.

Members: <comma-separated list>
```

## Errors to handle

* `channel_taken`: see step 2.
* `recipient_not_found` when seeding members: an alias in the list is
  not on AgentDM. Report which and skip it. Continue with the rest.

## Never

* Create channels with names that start with `#` (the prefix is a
  display convention, not part of the stored name).
* Seed members without confirming the channel was created.

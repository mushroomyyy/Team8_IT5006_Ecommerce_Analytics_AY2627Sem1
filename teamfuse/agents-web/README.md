# agents-web

The teamfuse control panel. A local Next.js dashboard shaped like an
electrical load center, with one breaker card per agent. Starts, stops,
wakes, and observes the sub-agents defined in `../agents.config.json`.
Binds to `127.0.0.1:3005` only.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind 3, Drizzle ORM on a
local SQLite file.

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://127.0.0.1:3005
```

The dashboard reads `../agents.config.json` for the agent roster. Until you
run the bootstrap flow (see the repo root `README.md`) that file does not
exist and the table is empty, which is expected.

## Environment variables

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `./data/control-plane.db` | SQLite file path |
| `AGENTS_CONFIG` | `../agents.config.json` | Path to the agent registry |
| `HOST` / `PORT` | `127.0.0.1` / `3005` | Dashboard bind |
| `USAGE_CAP_5H` | `100000000` | Upper bound for the 5h progress bar |
| `USAGE_CAP_7D` | `2000000000` | Upper bound for the 7d progress bar |

## What it does

On each request the dashboard re-reads every agent's `status.json`, checks
pid liveness from `agent_processes` in SQLite, reads `sleep.json` for the
next wake time, and walks each agent's Claude Code session transcripts under
`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/` to compute token usage.

Buttons per agent:

* **Start**. Spawns `scripts/agent-loop.sh <workingDir>` detached in a new
  process group. Writes a row into `agent_processes` and a
  `last-start.json` marker into `<workingDir>/.orchestrator/`.
* **Stop**. SIGTERM to the process group, then SIGKILL after 5 seconds if
  still alive. Drops the row from `agent_processes`.
* **Wake**. SIGUSR1 to the wrapper pid only (not the group). The wrapper's
  trap breaks its `sleep` so the next tick starts immediately.

See the root `docs/streaming-agent-loop.md` for how each agent's Claude Code
session is kept persistent across ticks.
